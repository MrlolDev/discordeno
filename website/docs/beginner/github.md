2. Give your repository a name and a short description.
3. Choose whether you want your repository to be public or private.
4. Select "Initialize this repository with a README" if you want to create a README file for your repository.

## Step 3: Add Files to Your Repository

1. Once you have created your repository, you can start adding files to it.
2. Click on the "Add file" button to create a new file or upload an existing file.
3. If you are uploading an existing file, you can drag and drop the file into the "Drag files here to add them to your repository" box.

## Step 4: Commit Changes
